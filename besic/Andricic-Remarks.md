# Remarks from Andricic

* How do you link your file with the current directory? (Pointer?)
* What would you do if you get really big file, for example Movie with 3 GB
* How do you get to the certain part?
* What if you get a block, which is half full?
  Would you split the data?
* Would you let the data on the blocks and the links would be destroyed or would you delete also the content?
