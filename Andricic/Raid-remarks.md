couldn't have said it better in the first question.

you should have a pointer to the first block

Answer: Every File has a pointer linked with the directory of his current directory.
  	    The File has in total two pointers given to the directory.
        The first pointer is the first node of the file and the second is the last node of the file.
        VERY IMPORTANT! One node is one Memory-Block.
        Also in the file, every single Memory-Block is linked with the previous and next.
