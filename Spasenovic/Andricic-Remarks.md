# Remarks of Andricic

Note: You should left a bit space between the hashtags and the content you're writing, because the md-file don't recognise it without spaces between.

* 1.) Where do you store the metadata?

* 2.) What would you change in the metadata?

* 4.) How do you know where the blocks are? Do you read the whole file until you
      find the block?

* Do you think the overwriting of the content, could possible cause performance issues?
